Project Title: BindingOfIsaac

Date: December 10, 2019

Project Description: This is a simple mimic game of Binding of Isaac written in Java. Upon running the game, you will see a quick prompt explaining the basic premise of the game as well as the controls. Upon hitting OK, you will be in a room with four monsters that chase you. If you get hit by a monster, you will lose a heart (shown at the top left), and if you lose all your hearts the game will close. The goal is to shoot the monsters with your tears using the spacebar. After defeating all four monsters, a door will open in the bottom right for you to go through. The next room contains a chest with a key that lets you go into the boss room, where you confront a slumbering monster who luckily stays asleep throughout the fight. Defeat the boss by bringing its health to zero (the health bar is above the boss). Upon defeating the boss, a trap door will be revealed under it. Move over the trap door and your character will go into it. After a few moments, the ending picture scrolls into the screen. The user is free to quit the game after that by exiting as normal.

This project integrated the use of .wav files into coding as well as testing my coding knowledge. While not as OOP-extensive as my other projects, it was still a fun challenge.

To Run: java .\Driver.java

This program requires a Java IDE of some kind to run. It has been tested both with BlueJ and Visual Studio Code.
